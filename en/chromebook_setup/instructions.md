You can [skip right over this section](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/installation/#install-python) if you're not using a Chromebook. If you
are, your installation experience will be a little different. You can ignore the
rest of the installation instructions.

### Cloud 9

Cloud 9 is a tool that gives you a code editor and access to a computer running
on the Internet where you can install, write, and run software. For the duration
of the tutorial, Cloud 9 will act as your _local machine_. You'll still be
running commands in a terminal interface just like your classmates on OS X,
Ubuntu, or Windows, but your terminal will be connected to a computer running
somewhere else that Cloud 9 sets up for you.

1. Install Cloud 9 from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud9/nbdmccoknlfggadpfkmcpnamfnbkmkcp)
2. Go to [c9.io](https://c9.io)
3. Sign up for an account
4. Click _Create a New Workspace_
5. Name it _django-girls_
6. Select the _Blank_ (second from the right on the bottom row with orange logo)

Now you should see an interface with a sidebar, a big main window with some
text, and a small window at the bottom that looks something like this:

{% filename %}Cloud 9{% endfilename %}
```
yourusername:~/workspace $
```

This bottom area is your _terminal_, where you will give the computer Cloud 9
has prepared for you instructions. You can resize that window to make it a bit bigger.
